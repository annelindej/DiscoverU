                <h2>Innovators</h2>
                
                    <b>The type:</b> Innovators have positive associations with technology. These associations are partly abstract, such as 'progress' and 'future.' They also consider the role they play in achieving that progress: development and design. You don't need to explain to these young people that the future perspective in a technical direction is good. They hear that from their social environment, a relatively large part of which works in a technical profession. They see technology as a direction with many possibilities. Therefore, this group more often chooses a technical direction in education. Their image of technology is high-tech: a clean environment with plenty of career opportunities.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Trigger:</b> Let me experience which innovations I can realize to make my environment proud.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Education:</b> Challenge innovators with assignments where both practice and theory are well intertwined. Don't make it too easy and provide opportunities for them to showcase or share their creation, for example, in a small exhibition or on an online platform. Innovators also believe that more time at school should be devoted to conducting experiments and carrying out creative assignments. Ensure that it is high-tech, though.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Future:</b> Innovative and large tech companies such as Apple, Google, and Tesla attract these young people. That makes sense: fascinating innovations are conceived here, and working for such an employer is prestigious. Therefore, showcase these types of companies (both international and Dutch) during career orientation and mention the educational paths that can lead to working there eventually.

                <h2>Social Implementers</h2>
                <b>The type:</b> Social Applicators more often associate technology with complexity (technology is difficult or intricate) and unattractiveness (boring, not cool, and dirty hands). This traditional perception is partly caused by fewer examples of what they can do with technology, both at home and in school, now and in their future. For instance, their social environment less frequently works in a technical profession. Social Applicators now more often choose a profile or sector in the direction of care, culture, or economics. However, for some of them, a technical direction actually fits well because technology plays a significant role in their area of interest. <br><br>
                <b>Trigger:</b> Let me discover how I can apply technology myself to improve people's lives.
                <br><br>
                <b>Education:</b> In education, these students struggle to focus on abstract mathematical or chemical formulas. Due to their insecurity, they are more likely to give up. Therefore, provide assignments with an appealing context, such as within the 7 Worlds of Technology. Which societal problem do I address with which solution? The robot itself is not interesting, but what that robot can mean for people is.       <br><br>
                <b>Future:</b> Show this group role models and stories that do not conform to the standard technical image. Consider the context of technology in healthcare: how do robots improve care in a hospital? And what career opportunities does this offer? Again, the context in which you can make a positive impact is more important than the technical action you will perform later.              <br><br>

                <h2>Doers</h2>
                <b>The type:</b> Doers primarily associate technology with electricity and professions such as (auto) mechanic, electrician, carpenter, and construction worker. In addition to these professions, they think of concrete forms such as devices, cars, and working with their hands. Their perception of technology is that it is outdated: for example, they less often associate it with modernity and progress than other groups. They especially feel that, in the current educational system, they have too few opportunities to get hands-on with technology, such as making things or conducting experiments. They disengage particularly from the theoretical side of subjects like mathematics, which, according to them, receives too much emphasis.         <br><br>
                <b>Trigger:</b> Let me get hands-on with technology earlier and discover that it's fun to engage with.
                <br><br>
                <b>Education:</b> These young individuals prefer to start by doing and then learn more about the underlying principles and formulas. Therefore, focus more on practical activities in education and bring enjoyable practical assignments into the classroom. Schools, both in primary and secondary education, currently vary widely in this regard. Experiences with making and experiments are the gateway for this group to see that technology can be enjoyable and to develop self-confidence.             <br><br>
                <b>Future:</b> Showcase professions and role models who derive their motivation and satisfaction from hands-on activities and creation. Enthusiastic technical professionals (engineers, mechanics) who can empathize with the fact that not everyone comes from a background of being a tech enthusiast but can eloquently talk about what they create, how they do it, and what their workday looks like. However, for activities related to Career Orientation and Guidance (LOB) aimed at Doers: encourage young people to engage in exciting assignments themselves, preferably involving modern technology to reshape their outdated perception of technology positively.              <br><br>

                <h2>Explorers</h2>
                <b>The type:</b> Explorers have a more neutral stance towards technology, and their perception is less fixed. They have fewer spontaneous associations with technology, and their spontaneous image tends to be somewhat conservative. Simultaneously, it's interesting that they become enthusiastic when presented with high-tech examples: robots, designing new applications, drones, developing new materials, etc. However, they still have limited exposure to such examples. They are unsure if they can handle technology, and they haven't identified their own technical talents yet. Therefore, choosing a technical direction can be daunting for them. This is particularly challenging on the pre-vocational secondary education (vmbo) level, where students make early choices. A technical profile (such as Production, Installation, and Energy) may feel too specific for these students compared to what they perceive as broader profiles. However, it's an advantage on the higher general secondary education (havo) and pre-university education (vwo) levels, where students see the Nature and Health Sciences (NG) and Nature and Technology (NT) combined profile as a direction that keeps all options open.          <br><br>
                <b>Trigger:</b> Allow me to explore the various technical directions and discover my talent within them.
                                <br><br>
                <b>Education:</b>  It's crucial for this group to encounter more high-tech examples, not only through media but also within the school environment. They become enthusiastic about it. By engaging with exciting examples, they can discover what they enjoy and excel in. For this group, practicality is often less important, so don't just focus on making; instead, involve them in designing, entrepreneurship, or contemplating the user of technology.               <br><br>
                <b>Future:</b> Show and let these young individuals experience that there are numerous possibilities with technology, providing clear examples. Those who are uncertain about their preferences won't readily choose a direction that feels too specific. The 7 Worlds of Technology can assist in this regard. These worlds showcase technology in seven contexts recognizable and concrete for young people. Think, for instance, of the worlds of Human & Health or Nutrition & Nature. By placing technology in various contexts and showing future-oriented examples, you stimulate the Explorer.                <br><br>

                <h2>Creative Makers</h2>
                
                <b>The type:</b> Creative Makers have a positive view of technology and take a broad perspective on it. They think about concrete things such as devices, machines, and electronics, as well as roles they would like to take on, such as designing and developing. Creativity and challenges are also aspects they associate with technology. Challenges, for this group, are seen as something positive; they believe they can handle technical subjects and, if they don't understand something, it's not a problem because, for them, technology is something one can learn with a bit of effort. Their willingness to improve in technology has a reason: besides being enjoyable, technology is seen as a means to address significant societal challenges, such as those related to climate or healthcare, where technology plays a positive role.
                <br><br>
                <b>Trigger:</b> Challenge me to come up with the best solution to a technical question.
                <br><br>
                <b>Education:</b> The Creative Maker is interested in new and challenging technology and enjoys working with it. In other words, they are enthusiasts who may disengage if there is too little excitement or challenge or if there are too many constraints. Make technology exciting and provide space for self-discovery.
                <br><br>
                <b>Future:</b> Occasionally connect lesson content and interesting issues to education/careers that also involve such questions. This way, young people gradually discover the available educational paths and which role and education suit them best.       <br><br>
